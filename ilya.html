              <p style="text-indent: 1.5rem;">
                In the Guild's early days, quests were usually limited to rumors or whether commoners could reach the
                front desk fast enough. This wasn't an issue at the beginning, as the guild only had so much manpower
                in the chaotic days of old. But as the guild grew with more members and influence, so too did
                misinformation, fraud, and lack of trust around various quest givers. Quests started to report
                mismatching information and rewards due to a variety of reasons: commoner lack of knowledge, greedy
                merchants, villainous individuals, and even just no one being in the area to confirm. The Guild
                attempted to mitigate this through an informal system of familiars, tools, and magic, but it wasn't
                enough. The Wolford Stars Incident and subsequent Twilight Battle of Wolford forced the Guild to
                acknowledge the their lack of information gathering and processing capabilities. As such, the Pathfinder
                Corp was established.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1.5rem;">
                The Pathfinder Corp was formed to cover the roles of intelligence gathering, quest verification, and
                regular scouting duties, however has since expanded to include exploring regions where guildmembers, and
                people in general, don't usually reach. Acting as the Guild's eyes and ears on the ground, pathfinders
                explore areas where the Guild can't through conventional means, gathering accurate information about
                possible quests and threats. They also act as a psuedo intelligence network in conjunction with various
                mercantile guilds.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1.5rem;">
                Pathfinders exist within the same hierarchy of the Guild, but are afforded more
                privileges and trust in exchange for stricter requirements and duties. In essence, they act as mobile
                guild staff, able to officiate in matters corresponding to their rank. They also carry specialized
                items including observation tools, priority communication tools, and evacuation equipment. At minimum
                pathfinders must be able to fight and survive long enough to deliver information back to the Guild.
                Usually they will stay onsite to act as guides or informants for guild members who follow. There are
                also pathfinders who specialize in espionage activities, gathering information on nations and
                organizations hostile to the guild. But most pathfinders explore less traveled and unknown regions.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 1.5rem;">
                For guild members, they are the guides and quest givers. For hostile forces, they are the encroaching
                signs of unwanted interlopers. But for the many who despair, they are first signs of hope, the hope that
                the Heroes will come.

          <div class="scrollbox">
            Every profession has its rumors; adventuring heroes have their tales of valor, enterprising merchants have
            their rumors of profit and wealth, scheming nobles have their gossip of ill tidings. For the working staff
            of various guild halls across Melicau, their whispers talk of those who walk through their doors. From
            rumors of celebrity appearances to ill mannered customers and enigmatic figures, all are not above the
            scrutiny of a staffer. However, few rumors are as widespread as the sightings of the Wandering Wizard, a
            figure who seems to be everywhere and nowhere at once, always in the wind. The small side stories her
            appearances accompany usually include a basic description of her figure and her book, a brief yet pleasant
            interaction, and the prologue to a much grander tale. To many, she is a mysterious traveler, walking across
            far reaching distances, appearing and disappearing at towns and villages for reasons unknown. But for the
            staff of the Guild of Heroes, she is their ally and friend among bureaucratic paperwork, the Pathfinder Ilya
            Reyes.
            <br /><br />
            A brief search of recent years in the Guild Archive will create a timeline of Ilya Reyes’s long and storied
            wanderings. She joined the Guild at the age of 15, already exploring the world and carrying the arcane
            legacy of her family, an odd family with other mentions in the annals of history. Apparently she was found
            by an adventuring group of Heroes on their own quest and was convinced to join the Guild. Her own stated
            reason for joining is “if I’m going to be exploring the world, might as well do some good for this world.”
            She was immediately placed under the attention of an experienced Master rank Pathfinder, a spellweaver who
            once worked as the receptionist at the HQ of the Guild. Her apprenticeship under a Pathfinder was meant to
            only be a way to keep up with her wandering nature, but it turned out to be a boon for the Guild. Ilya could
            handle a variety of intelligence gathering and processing missions, and penned many quality reports to the
            guild. Within those reports shone a strong understanding of the arcane and a drive for exploration and
            learning. Documented interactions with her have shown her to maintain a pleasant and friendly nature, an
            inquisitive mind, and a love of exploration. Later interviews with Ilya exposed another motive for her
            movements: “to read all of my family’s compendium and to add my own words to it.”
            <br /><br />
            Eventually a recommendation from her master and various staff members in the Guild led to her joining the
            Pathfinder Corp, subsequently followed by a promotion to Hero rank. At the age of 19, she began her travels
            independently once more, serving the Guild as one of its best Pathfinders. She has since started tales of
            her own, garnering a small reputation of reliability and assurance among both Guild members and staff. For
            those familiar with the Guild, her presence in paper is a common sight, and her presence in person is a
            rarity. Regardless, she remains a welcome part of the Guild of Heroes.

            <div class="infor leftindent">As the inheritor of the Reyes family Compendium, she has access to a wide
              array of magical spells and arcane knowledge. As long as she wields the compendium, she can draw out any
              number of spells without looking, as long as she can read past her ancestors ciphers and understand the
              arcane meaning behind it. The compendium contains spells from various different regions and draws upon
              various different schools of magic. The types of magic include but are not limited to elemental, life,
              spatial, healing, enchantment, illusions, etc.</div>

            <div class="infor leftindent">As a well seasoned traveler, Ilya has learned how to survive and thrive in the
              outdoors. Light, healing, water, cooking, cleaning, everything one would need to live the nomad life.

            <div class="infor leftindent">Ilya almost always has enchantments that improve her traveling capabilities.
              This is usually strengthen, fleet foot, featherstep, and night vision.</div>
